# Stranger Days Calendar 

Nowadays, we know about the existence of many international and world days ðŸ“†, but sometimes we hear about world days that we have to read twice to believe.

I'm sure you're not surprised that we celebrate Mother's Day or Earth Day, but would you believe that thereâ€™s Star Wars World Geek Day or Mother-in-law's Day?

Yes, you read that right. Every day has weird celebrations too, strange world days that are nevertheless celebrated and have quite a lot of importance somewhere in the world.
That's why we've created this calendar of weird days inspired by Netflix's hit series Stranger Things.

We have included a beta with the weirdest days of the month of May. For this we have used a trend in social networks, which is the use of icons to guess what day it is. With this calendar you will not only be able to add personal or work events to each day, but also start the day with a smile, remember a friend, or even get inspiration to do something, like eating a hamburger on May 28th!
